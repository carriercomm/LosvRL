A homage to Seth Able Robinson's Legend of the Red Dragon

Using NrknLib:

Intent is for it to be browser-based if I have time to fix my console 
server/client code, if I do then also using jConsole:

Story (vague):
  The village is renowned throughout the lands for its high quality cheese,
  sourced from its legendary cheese mines. However the mines are necessarily far
  from the village, the dense forest between the village and the mines being
  overrun with all manner of dangerous creatures. Due to the hazards of
  transporting the cheese back to the village the local sorcerer fashioned a
  huge golem out of (what else) cheese to help protect the cheese wagon during 
  its trips to and from the mines. Unfortunately something went wrong and the 
  golem turned on the villagers. It now mindlessly guards the cheese mines and
  the supply has almost dried up... someone has to do something, and that 
  someone is you.

I'll be pushing out to Github as I go.

As a child you recall:
Staring into a bubbling cauldron of fondue while muttering arcanely
Bludgeoning rats and mice to death with huge wheels of cheese
Sneaking into the village stores with a packet of crackers for a midnight snack
